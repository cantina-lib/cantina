### Info

Library for processing signal input through a vocoder controlled by MIDI Input 
(carrier frequency and velocity, modulated by MIDI controllers and envelopes).


### Build

#### State:

Working on Linux. Have issues linking to FFTW on Windows.

#### Dependencies:

	FFTW       (included)
	SoundTouch (included)
	
##### On Debian:

	sudo apt install libsndfile-dev vamp-plugin-sdk
	
### To do

#### Features 

- [ ] Move responsability of MIDI tone <-> frequency conversion to EurÃªka when ready.
- [ ] Add support of phase-based pitch shifting with RubberBand.
- [ ] Implement mixed pitch shifting for semi-static pitch shifting to harmonics.

#### Fixes

- [ ] Audio signal frets when starting and stopping note. 
Testing revealed that it was not obviously related to velocity changes.
